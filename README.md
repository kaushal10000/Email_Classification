EMAIL SPAM CLASSIFICATION

This project leverages a variety of machine learning algorithms to classify emails as spam or not spam, each contributing a unique approach to solving the problem.
1.	SVC and Logistic Regression utilize mathematical models to identify email patterns and make classifications based on these features.
2.	K-Neighbors Classifier predicts spam by evaluating the similarity to nearby emails.
3.	Decision Trees, along with ensemble methods like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting, combine multiple models to enhance prediction accuracy and reduce errors.
4.	Naive Bayes and XGBoost focus on probabilistic models, optimizing performance for large datasets.
5.	AdaBoost and Bagging are employed to adjust for difficult cases and reduce the risk of overfitting.

Collectively, these models create a strong approach for accurately identifying spam emails, providing adaptability and increased precision across various datasets.
